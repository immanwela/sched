                <p>Cebu Eastern College (CEC) is a private, co-educational Chinese-Filipino school in Cebu City. Its roots can be traced to the Cebu Chinese School, founded in 1915, and the Cebu Sun Yat Sen High School, founded in 1925. The school was born as the Cebu Chinese High School out of the merging of the two said schools in 1938. In 1950, the high school earned government recognition as a non-sectarian school, opening its doors to students of all nationalities. Twelve years later, the Chinese High School was renamed to the Cebu Eastern College, at the same time it began developing its college department.</p><br>
                <p>For college students, the school provides degree courses in Teacher Education, Hotel and Tourism Management, Development Communication, and Information Technology.</p><br>
                <p>Cebu Eastern College is one of the oldest Chinese schools in the Philippines and continues to have Chinese classes in its program curricula. Since its establishment, CEC has also been committed to providing the right environment to develop its students holistically in terms of their skills and values. Graduates of Cebu Eastern College become professionals who reflect competence and concern for the community.</p>
